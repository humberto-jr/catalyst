# modules

A collection of lightweight modules that wraps the boilerplate code required for calling the C/C++ standard library and third-party code. These would encapsulate type conversions, enforcing const correctness, internal state management, error handling, thread safety, message passing, I/O, GPUs, algorithms, math, coding conventions, etc. While it is intended to provide a clean, more readable and safe API, it should not become a barrier to accessing a lower-level API for the sake of, say, performance.
